# Vulnerability Discovery

We are going to look at `CVE-2019-2215` which is a `Use after Free` vulnerability in **Binder IPC** subsystem.

This is a very **severe** vulnerability because **binder** subsystem is reachable from **Chrome sandbox** and can lead to privilege escalation if chained with a **renderer exploit**.


## Original Discovery {#original-discovery}

This bug was initially discovered by **syzbot (syzkaller bot)** in the month of **November 2017** without a reproducer. In the month of **December 2017** **syzbot** was able to find a reproducer. You can find the original bug report here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/syzkaller-bugs/QyXdgUhAF50/eLGkcwk9AQAJ

This bug was patched in **February 2018** without a **CVE** number. Hence, the patch was not **back-ported** to many already released devices like **Pixel** and **Pixel 2**.


## Rediscovery {#rediscovery}

This bug was rediscovered by **Maddie Stone (@maddiestone)** of **Project Zero** based on an intelligence report from Google's **Threat Analysis Group (TAG)**. She reported this vulnerability on **27th September 2019**. You can find Maddie's report here https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942

The rediscovery of this bug is very interesting, **Maddie** documented it with the exploitation primitive here https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html

I strongly suggest you all to read the blog post, so that you know the interesting story about the rediscovery of this bug.

    ANDROID: binder: remove waitqueue when thread exits.
    
    commit f5cb779ba16334b45ba8946d6bfa6d9834d1527f upstream.
    
    binder_poll() passes the thread->wait waitqueue that
    can be slept on for work. When a thread that uses
    epoll explicitly exits using BINDER_THREAD_EXIT,
    the waitqueue is freed, but it is never removed
    from the corresponding epoll data structure. When
    the process subsequently exits, the epoll cleanup
    code tries to access the waitlist, which results in
    a use-after-free.
    
    Prevent this by using POLLFREE when the thread exits.
